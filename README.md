# Ai-OrderingSystem
Overview
This repository contains the updated version of my Final Year Project completed during my university studies. The main aim of this project is to enhance my skills in modern web development technologies, particularly React.js and Node.js, as well as further develop its functionality.

# Improvements
In this version, I've completely converted the original project to React.js and Node.js, which greatly improves the structure and functionality of the application. This will provide a smoother, more responsive user experience, as well as introduce better scalability and maintainability.

# Future Development
I plan to continue improving this project by adding additional features, including:

 - Admin Accounts: To give administrative users more control over managing the system.
 - Advanced AI System: I'm integrating a more sophisticated artificial intelligence to enhance the project's capabilities.
 - More Intuitive Interface: The user interface will receive continuous improvements, focusing on making the platform even more user-friendly and responsive.

# Skills Developed
Throughout the development of this project, I aim to:

 - Strengthen my understanding of React.js for building dynamic and performant user interfaces.
 - Improve my backend skills using Node.js and Express for handling server-side logic.
 - Gain deeper experience in API development, database management, and working with third-party libraries.
